The appplication is available at [https://cic-virtual-board.web.app](https://cic-virtual-board.web.app)

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) is used for storage and hosting. These technologies was chosen as they are familiar technologies and great for prototyping. The application also makes use of material-icons for icons and react-bootstrap for some styling of forms and cards.
